# Anamoly_Detection
The provided code implements anomaly detection using Isolation Forest on the "penguins" dataset from seaborn. 
It includes basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) such as displaying dataset information and descriptive statistics. 
Categorical features are encoded for use in Isolation Forest, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance. 
The code evaluates the model using a classification report, handling anomalies with labels [1, -1], and visualizes the anomaly scores across the dataset to identify outliers effectively. 
Overall, it aims to detect anomalies in the penguins dataset using Isolation Forest.
